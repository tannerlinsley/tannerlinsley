Hello! I build open source software that is currently used by hundreds of thousands of developers at companies ranging from fortune 500 companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Walmart, and Target all the way down to startups and indie developers.

Most of my open source software is written in Javascript and focused on React, Remote/Server State Management, Data Grids/Tables, Data Visualization, and Enterprise Application Architecture.
